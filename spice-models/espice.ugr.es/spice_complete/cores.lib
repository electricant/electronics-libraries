SPICE Simulation Models
These SPICE simulation models may be used and distributed freely, 
provided they are not altered in any way, resold, or included in 
any other package for resale. In addition, the Intusoft copyright
notice MUST be maintained and included with any model distribution.

As a service to our customers, we provide a free modeling service.  
If you are interested in obtaining additional models, please contact 
Intusoft technical support.

ICAP/4 Windows Demonstration Software
The demonstration version of ICAP/4 Windows including IsSpice4 may be 
downloaded from our Web site at no charge.  
Also available for download are additional models, product and 
ordering information, technical articles, and Intusoft Newsletters.

These models are part of the ICAP/4Windows Deluxe package which currently
includes over 10,000 models and hundreds of different part types. With
regard to the number of part types, it is the largest library available
from ANY SPICE vendor!!

SpiceMod Modeling Software
SpiceMod is a CAE program that is used to create SPICE models from 
data sheet values.  SPICEMOD is particularly useful in the circuit 
design phase because it allows the designer to create SPICE models 
based on electrical specifications before an actual device is selected.
SpiceMod may be used to create models for diodes, Zener diodes, BJTs,
power BJTs, Darlington BJTs, JFETs, MOSFETs, power MOSFETs, IGBTs, 
SCRs, and TRIACS.

which the model relates. Moreover, these models are

thereof and Intusoft specifically disclaims all implied

Although the use of macromodels can be a useful tool in evaluating
device performance in various applications, they cannot
model exact device performance under all conditions, nor are
they intended to replace breadboarding for final
verification.
