These models are part of the ICAP/4Windows Deluxe package which currently
includes over 10,000 models and hundreds of different part types. With
regard to the number of part types, it is the largest library available
from ANY SPICE vendor!!

* "SPICE Modeling of Capacitors" by John Prymak. Kemet Electronics Corp.
* 
* IMPORTANT NOTE: These models use the key word FREQ in the B element 
* expression. This capability is only available in IsSpice4 version 7.6
* or greater!!!!!!!!

SPICE Simulation Models
These SPICE simulation models may be used and distributed freely, 
provided they are not altered in any way, resold, or included in 
any other package for resale. In addition, the Intusoft copyright
notice MUST be maintained and included with any model distribution.

As a service to our customers, we provide a free modeling service.  
If you are interested in obtaining additional models, please contact 
Intusoft technical support.

ICAP/4 Windows Demonstration Software
The demonstration version of ICAP/4 Windows including IsSpice4 may be 
downloaded from our Web site at no charge.  
Also available for download are additional models, product and 
ordering information, technical articles, and Intusoft Newsletters.

SpiceMod Modeling Software
SpiceMod is a CAE program that is used to create SPICE models from 
data sheet values.  SPICEMOD is particularly useful in the circuit 
design phase because it allows the designer to create SPICE models 
based on electrical specifications before an actual device is selected.
SpiceMod may be used to create models for diodes, Zener diodes, BJTs,
power BJTs, Darlington BJTs, JFETs, MOSFETs, power MOSFETs, IGBTs, 
SCRs, and TRIACS.

Although the use of macromodels can be a useful tool in evaluating
device performance in various applications, they cannot
model exact device performance under all conditions, nor are
they intended to replace breadboarding for final
verification.

* Ceramic Capacitor Subcircuit Notes
* Rnom is the minimum resistance at self-resonance (Fres)

* The self resonance is widened out by the 1.5 factor (in the Log expression), 
* chosen as a best fit to actual data.

* The typical capcitance variation is 10% lot-lot and for ESR 20% within 
* a lot. ESR lot-lot may be greater.

* Except for NP0 and C0G caps, the bias voltage will have a 
* suppressive effect on ESR and capacitance.

* Ttest is the temperature of the capacitor. It may also be set to 
* "TEMP" (= to the .Options TEMP value).

* RCP and CP create a secondary or parallel resonance that represents 
* a capacitance that shunts the RLC elements due mainly to the capacitance 
* from the termination faces separated the length of the chip.

* Lx is used to keep the parallel resonance in check and account for the pads.
* Rx is a resistor that keeps the impedance reasonable at very high frequencies.
* Rx + Rcp should approach the imedance of free space, 377Ohms. A default value
* of 150 Ohms has been used but this value should be adjusted to 
* (377- (1000*Rnom)).

* CP is dependent on the body and chip size.

* Vbias is the dc bias voltage across the capacitor. If the value is not known
* you should run an operating point analysis to find the value which can then
* be inserted back into the model.

* The FREQ variable is 0 during the transient (time) analysis. This will
* tend to make the ESR very high.

* RESR = Rnom * Temperature term * (1 + (Frequency term * Bias term))
* CNOM = Cnom * Bias term * Temperature term
