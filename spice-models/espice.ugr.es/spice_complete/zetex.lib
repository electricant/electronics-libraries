* 
*The model below simulates the normal transistor operation.  If you  
*wish to simulate the transistor in avalanche a simple model can be  
*constructed using a switch in series with a resistor, a voltage source  
*and an inductor.  For initial simulation with Vcc of 240V and minimum  
*lead length try 2ohm, 40V and 4nH.  The avalanche performance is  
*highly dependent on the external circuit components and  
*interconnections which must be modelled with stray inductance and  
*resistive losses. 
* 
*This model was prepared using MicroSim PSpice. 
*Spice software which does not support RCO & GAMMA will  
*model the quasi-saturation region incorrectly.  The 
*resulting model will return optimistic values for 
*forward Vcesat, current gain and Tdon.   
*To improve simulation in a simplified model try  
*increasing RE and decreasing BF and IKF
