* IsSpice4 Model thermal circuit file for the following parts:
* HUF75309T3ST
* 
* This netlist represents an equivalent electrical circuit of the typical
* junction to case thermal path of the die and package combination. Power
* dissipated in this path is represented by current into the junction node
* Temperature at the case or junction node is represented by the
* voltage level at that node.
